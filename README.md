# Auto-Insurance-Pricing-and-Rate-Indication-using-GLMs-Poisson-Gamma-Tweedie-
Auto Insurance Pricing and Rate Indication using GLMs (Poisson–Gamma–Tweedie)

This project builds a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)–based pricing framework for an auto insurance portfolio using the Spain Auto Insurance dataset.
The objective is to estimate indicated pure premiums by modeling claim frequency (Poisson), severity (Gamma), and a combined Tweedie model for total annual claim costs.
The results are used to evaluate rate adequacy, analyze risk relativities, and identify rating factors that influence premiums across driver, vehicle, and regional segments.

This project demonstrates a complete actuarial modeling workflow—from data preparation to statistical modeling and diagnostics in Python, with interpretation aligned to P&C pricing practices.
